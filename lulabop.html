                <p>
                    Lulabop is an outdoor gadget and lifestyle company bent on taking over the world with their reimagined caribiner clip. Their mission is to make lives better by creating clever product solutions for everyday problems. 

                    Though Lulabop had their own challenges, namely wanting to direct more traffic and sales through their own online store, rather than their amazon page. Their page wasn’t converting as many users as they’d aspired to, and they weren’t sure why.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The current structure and organization of information on the Lulabop.com website concerning Lulabop the company and their main product, the Hero Clip, was not converting traffic to purchases at an optimal rate. 

                    How could we leverage an existing user base coupled with a robust wholesale business, and direct its energies through the preferred sales route of the product website?

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    No design problem is complete without its challenges, and Lulabop had one major one. Lulabop’s ecommerce portal is built on Shopify’s framework, and the theme had to stay. They’d invested quite a bit to get what they had off of the ground, and overhauling or choosing a new theme wasn’t in scope.

                </p>
            </div>

        <section id="about" class='row'>

                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <h3>Hero Imagery</h3>
                <p>
                    The user testing was incredibly revealing. Lulabop’s website was recieving quite a bit of traffic due to their marketing pushes, but their bounce-rate was incredibly high. Testing revealed that the hero-video Lulabop originally had at the very top of their landing page took sometimes over 7 seconds to load. They were losing a huge bulk of their users on page load.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To solve for this we replaced the video with a hero imagery slideshow, and moved the video to a lower section on the landing page. This change alone lowered their load tmies almost 90%. We also added a call-to-action button to direct users to immediately shop their best products.
                </p>
                <h3>A Name Change</h3>
                <p>
                    A lot of feedback from users confirmed that the names of some of Lulabop’s products were unclear or confusing, especially when nested near eachother. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team we were able to participate in the re-naming and re-branding of Lulabop’s main product, and a well-responded survey helped us nail down a new name for what was formerly known as the Qliptlet, which became The Hero Clip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lulabop benefited from reorganizing some of the links on their navigation in order to differentiate their products and funnel traffic accordingly.

                <h2>Collaborative Design Studio</h2>
                <p>
                    There is one design method that I think can be a complete game-changer, depending on the client, and with Lulabop we were able to make this magic happen. Before exploring fully fleshed-out solutions, we wanted to take the time as a team to present our research and invite the client to participate in sketching with us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be a scary moment. Everyone fears the blank page in front of them, and the client might not get it. If you can positively coach your team and client into sketching as a group without fear, the outcome can be not only efficient, but incredibly helpful to coming to a solution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only does the client get to come along the journey of creation, but they come to fully understand and value how much of an impact design can make to their business.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When a whole team comes together to sketch as a group the amount of work that is generated is incredible.
